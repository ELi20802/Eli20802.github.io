        My favorite place is Port Jefferson Harbor, a harbor near where I grew up. 
        When I was young, the local Asian and Pacific Islander community used to hold Dragon Boat Festivals near the docks.
        At night, I liked to walk along the dock and watch the ships in the harbor. One of my childhood dreams was to work on a boat.
        
        <p>My favorite restaurant is <a href="https://www.phoandricema.com/">Pho and Rice.</p> </a>

        <p>A fun fact about me: I was named after Ross and Rachel's baby from Friends.
